# Breast Cancer Analysis Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook provides a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-learn. It includes data loading, basic exploration, and initial analysis steps.

## Algorithms Used:

This notebook utilizes **seven machine learning models** to analyze the breast cancer dataset:

- **Logistic Regression**: For binary classification of cancer types.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: To analyze feature importance and make predictions.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: For classification based on feature similarity.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: For optimal separation of malignant and benign tumors.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: To improve prediction accuracy using an ensemble of decision trees.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Based on probabilistic classification using Bayes' theorem.
- **Artificial Neural Network Classifier**: For boosting the performance of weak classifiers.

## Prediction Type:

- **Binary Classification**: Predicting whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

## Requirements:

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
